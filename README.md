## Initial Project Outline
Authored by Brad Mallow

This repository serves as a plain, forkable starting point for your frontend code challenge, which is intended to be an open-ended opportunity to show how you write code and solve problems.

In this challenge we would like you to access a JSON feed of the [most popular New York Times science articles](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/science.json?api-key=Gwxln5M3geWlhR6UE0TY1FUWKSG3wCil) and use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an interface to display them. Your solution should aim to fulfill the following requirements, in order of priority:
1. Display a list of articles.
1. Implement a search feature to dynamically filter articles.
1. Search terms should match against the following article attributes:
   1. title
   1. byline
   1. section

Your solution can use plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, or you can use any languages, libraries, or frameworks you would like to achieve the task. We expect this project should take 2-3 hours, and would encourage you not to spend more than 3 hours on it.

You can access the API via the following link:
https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/science.json?api-key=Gwxln5M3geWlhR6UE0TY1FUWKSG3wCil

Start by forking this repo. When you're finished please send a link to your public fork. In addition, if you can enable GitHub pages on your forked repo, so your solution can be easily previewed, that would be extra helpful.
